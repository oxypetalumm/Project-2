# Project 2

This project has been cooperating with Elstan and Carmen. 

The project is about California cities' crime. We used FBI crime datasets for 2017, 2018, and 2019 to make interactive tables, Plotly charts and Google charts for visitors to explore crime records by city. 

### Interactive Table

Our interactive table includes FBIâ€™s crime data of all California cities for 2017, 2018, and 2019. Since the table is very long and wide, it is built to have vertical and horizontal scroll bars. With the interactive filter, visitor can enter any California city to see the crime records for 2017, 2018, and 2019.

### Interactive Plotly Charts

Our interactive Plotly charts show California's top 10 dangerous and top 10 safe cities for years 2017, 2018, and 2019 based on the FBI datasets. We Google searched a couple websites about California's top 10 dangerous and top 10 safe cities. It turned out Google results were not necessary correctly reflecting California's top 10 dangerous and tope 10 safe cities based on FBI's datasets. 

### Interactive Google Charts

Our Google charts show California's top 10 large and top 10 small cities by population for years 2017, 2018, and 2019 based on the FBI datasets. With comparison of these population charts to the crime charts about top 10 dangerous and top 10 safe cities, we found correlation between crime and population. The larger the population, there could be higher crimes.

There has been issues making our Plotly charts and Google charts load on a server, but everything loads as expected locally. We have been trying to figure out why and how we can fix the errors. The console shows some errors. We were able to fix some and asked for help from the instructional team and from AskBCS Learning Assistant. Errors still can't be fixed. My team will continue to figure out why and how to make the charts load on a server in addition to loading well locally.
