This project has been cooperating with Elstan Tam and Carmen Ho. 

The project is about California cities' crime. We made interactive tables, Plotly charts and Google charts.

There has been issues making our Plotly charts and Google charts load on a server, but everything works nicely locally. All the charts load as expected locally. We have been trying to figure out why and how we can fix the errors. The console shows some errors. I was able to fix some and asked for help from the instructional team and from AskBCS Learning Assistant. Errors still haven't been fixed. I and my team will continue to figure out why and how to make the charts load on a server in addition to loading well locally.
